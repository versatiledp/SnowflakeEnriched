<h2>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a autumn day of 2020 with COVID lockdown, our office team was working on data engineering research using
Databricks. Having always believed in the power of education, Raj began considering writing a book
on Databricks data engineering aspects. He met with his colleague Babu over coffee in the evening and talked about it.</p>
<p>Raj and Babu decided to take upon the venture of writing a book on Snowflake for the SQL developer community, and
eventually asked another colleague Siva to join along in the journey.
Together, we made a commitment of three hours a day, three days a week, over the next three months of our lives to make our dream come true.
Looking back, our experience has taught us that one only needs dedication to achieve success.</p>
<p>Through this all, we have shared a common goal of contributing to the society we migrated from: India.
So, we will use any proceeds/donations we collect from this book to fund NGOs working to better Indian education.</p>
<p>The main objective in the book is to lay-out a complete data platform solution that solves business stakeholders’ needs.
We include hands-on code throughout the book, so that the user community can take the book’s datasets and execute the code
to get a better sense of the solution.</p>
<p>Many existing books have scattered examples to cover different aspects of the underlying technology.
We instead wanted to employ a project-driven approach, consisting of data collection, modeling, ingestion, transformation,
and visualization. To the current developer community using SQL for existing relational database solutions,
this book will serve as a tool for software development using Snowflake.</p>
<p>We hope readers will find this book easy to follow and helpful for learning Snowflake and project-based learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The only prerequisite to follow along with this book is account with Snowflake and Google.
Readers can use Snowflake free trial services and try out all the samples from start
to finish, while the Google account will be needed to execute the colab Juypter notebook.</p>
<p>We also assume that readers have had some working experience in database programming fields.
They should be familiar with any relational database engine and high level programming lanaguge.</p>
